# Using vscode snippets efficiently

When we write code, there are things that we do quite often. How many times did you write an HTML document's basic structure? Or a React component? Or even just a `console.log`?

You can re-type these things again and again every time you need to, but you can also leverage vscode's snippet feature, allowing to quickly drop some code template anywhere.

## Creating a snippet with vscode

Sorry for those who aren't using vscode, but I'm sure you can find something equivalent with your favorite editor too.

To create a new snippet, you'll just need to create a file within vscode's config directory, usually it will be in `~/.config/Code/User/snippets`. The snippet are JSON files, but their extension should be `.code-snippet`.

You can also create a snippet from the command palette, by searching for "Configure User Snippets", then "New Global Snippets fileâ€¦".

Here is the format for a snippet definition (and [here is the documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets)):

```json filename="~/.config/Code/User/snippets/my-snippet.code-snippets" caption="vscode snippet definition"
{
  "Snippet name": {
    "description": "Description",
    "body": [
      "line1",
      "line2",
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also add a `prefix` key, which will allow inserting the snippet by typing this prefix and accept the snippet suggestion from the autocomplete menu. But this is not how I like to insert a snippet, I'll come back to this later.

Often, you'll want your snippet to only exist within a given context, while writing code in some specific language. You'll never want to write a `console.log` in some python source code, would you? To achieve this, you can add a `scope` key, and it's value should be a [language identifier](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers).

## Inserting a snippet

Okay, so the common (and default) way of inserting snippets is to write something, then press tab. But I personally find it annoying, because of two reasons:

- I may insert snippets by error if I mistype something
- It requires writing a prefix, and then press enter, which is too many keystrokes in my opinion

Instead, I find it extremely convenient to use [chords shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-rules), like `alt+x t`. We first press `alt+x`, release everything, and then just press `t`. I do you `alt+x <letter>` for all my snippets (and I use `x` because it's right above the `alt` key).

If you want to try this, you will also want to exclude the snippet suggestion from vscode's autocompletion system, by adding this to your configuration:

```json filename="~/.config/Code/User/settings.json" caption="Disable vscode snippets suggestions"
"editor.snippetSuggestions": "none"
```

So why do I prefer to use chords, you ask? Well, for many reasons. First, I only use 3 keystrokes to insert any snippet. Second, I can set some places where the cursor should be moved to after inserting the snippet, allowing to customize the inserted template. And also, I can quickly insert a snippet while having a selection, which can be pretty neat, thanks to variables interpolations.

## Variables interpolations

A snippet is actually more powerful than just a bunch of code, as it can contain variables, like the current file's name, the current date, the cursor's index, or a randomly generated UUID. All available variables are documented [right here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables).

## Some of my favorite snippets

Here are some of the snippets I use the most, feel free to grab them for yourself! And if you find ways to improve them, please pleeeease let me know! ðŸ˜€

And if you want more, check out the whole list of snippets on [my dotfiles](https://github.com/nilscox/.dotfiles/tree/master/vscode/snippets).

### Log something to the console

`console.log`'s cousin that you'll love to use if you don't already.

```json filename="console-dir.code-snippet"
{
  "console dir": {
    "scope": "javascript,javascriptreact,typescript,typescriptreact",
    "body": ["console.dir(${1:$TM_SELECTED_TEXT}, { depth: null });"]
  }
}
```

### Wait for a timeout

Await a promise created on the fly after some time (useful to debug race conditions).

```json filename="wait.code-snippet"
{
  "wait": {
    "scope": "javascript,typescript,javascriptreact,typescriptreact",
    "body": [
      "await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, $1));"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Wrap a selection in a html / React tag

I use this one all the time when I code in React, and it's so simple!

```json filename="wrap.code-snippet"
{
	"wrap": {
		"description": "Wrap a selection between a JSX tag",
		"scope": "html,javascriptreact,typescriptreact",
		"body": [
			"<${0}>$TM_SELECTED_TEXT</$0>"
		]
	}
}
```

### Declare a React component

You'll need to either adapt the transformations, or use uppercase letters in the files names, though.

```json filename="react-component.code-snippet"
{
  "react component": {
    "scope": "typescriptreact",
    "body": [
      "type ${1:${TM_FILEPATH/.*\\/(.*)\\/index\\.[jt]sx?$|.*\\/(.*)\\.[jt]sx?$/$1$2/}}Props = {",
      "  $2",
      "};",
      "",
      "const ${1} = ({ $3 }: ${1}Props) => {",
      "  return (",
      "    <$4>",
      "      $0",
      "    </$4>",
      "  );",
      "};"
    ]
  }
}
```

### ESModule import

Just add a simple import.

```json filename="esm-import.code-snippet"
{
  "import": {
    "scope": "javascript,javascriptreact,typescript,typescriptreact",
    "body": [
      "import $1 from '${2:$1}';"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Scaffold a HTML document's structure

And last but not least...

```json filename="html-document.code-snippet"
{
	"html": {
		"scope": "html",
		"body": [
			"<!DOCTYPE html>",
			"<html>",
			"	<head>",
			"		<meta charset=\"utf8\">",
			"		<title>$2</title>",
			"	</head>",
			"	<body>",
			"		$1",
			"	</body>",
			"</html>"
		]
	}
}
```
