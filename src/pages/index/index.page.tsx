  <Section title="About me">
    <p>So you want to know a bit more about me? Sure! What can I tell you...?</p>

    <p>
      I come from Le Havre (France), I went to <a href="https://epita.fr">EPITA</a> an engineering school in
      Paris, and I worked as a full-stack web developer for several startups. Throughout my different
      experiences, I acquired the skills I use today to build apps, from understanding the needs to deploying
      and maintaining a technical solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      What do I mean by "making things right", you ask? Well, a lot actually... In short, I always do my best
      to build resilient, unit-tested systems, and I spend a lot of time learning about what I believe are{' '}
      <strong>good practices</strong> (clean code, clean architecture, microservices, test-driven development,
      domain-driven design, SOLID principles, etc.) in order to keep <strong>high quality standards</strong>{' '}
      while being pragmatic in my decision making process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Apart from coding, I also{' '}
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/brainwave-1" className="text-inherit hover:underline">
        make music
      </a>
      , beer, I do a bit of slackline and stuff that regular people do, like playing video games and watching
      tv shows. But I spend most of my free time coding on my side projects.
